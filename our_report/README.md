# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
We'll work on an e-textile.Specifically we're thinking of a pirate flag embedded with led lights, which will be controlled with either a button push or a pressure plate. We are targeting people who like pirates (such as gamers, film lovers, anime watchers etc). It's value is purely cosmetic/entertaining and we'll make use of patterned lights! We're gonna use LED lights, and a Lilypad as a base and either make our own diy pressure plate or use a button from another device.

# 2nd Deliverable
Information Architecture
  Other LED flags do exist, but they are an soleley electronic, while we are thinking og adding electronic devices to an already existing product ( our own flag). We        also found a method of constructing your own makeshift button/pressure plate, which we could implement in the final design.We'll use seperate LED ligths of the          generic type and not an LED strip.
User Interaction
  We'll have the flag in front of the user and with the push of a button there will be changes in the behaviour of the LED's.
  One push will activate the LED's.A second one will trigger the first patterb to be formed, while a third one will nake the second pattern to appear.Another push and      the LED's will deactivate.If the lights stay on for more than 3 minutes they will deactivate automatically.
Interface Design
  The product will be composed from: a) a Lilypard b) 20 generic LED's c) 20 resistors (220 Ohms) d) a wire and e) our makeshift button. The button (input) is conected to the LilyPad, which transfers the info to the lights (output).
